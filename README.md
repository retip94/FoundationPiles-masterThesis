# FoundationPiles-masterThesis
Foundation piles designing plugin to SOLDIS PROJEKTANT software (Topic of our master thesis in Civil Engineering Faculty at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology).

## Getting started
Whole project was written in Python 2.7.
Unfortunetly this plugin cannot be run standalone, so I put here some pictures of it. There's the whole paper attached, where all algorithm are explained.
